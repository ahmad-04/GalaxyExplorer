# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements a devvit block system for posts that displays interactive content before showing popups or overlays. The system will provide a native Reddit-integrated experience where users can interact with post content directly within the Reddit interface before launching the full webview application. This follows the pattern established by successful devvit apps like Pixelary, where users see engaging preview content that encourages interaction with the full app.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a Reddit user browsing posts, I want to see interactive preview content within the post itself, so that I can understand what the app offers before deciding to open the full experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user views a Galaxy Explorer post THEN the system SHALL display a devvit block with preview content similar to Pixelary's post preview format instead of immediately showing the splash screen
2. WHEN the devvit block is rendered THEN it SHALL show game-relevant information such as level preview, difficulty, or creator details in a compact, visually appealing format matching Pixelary's design patterns
3. WHEN the user interacts with the devvit block THEN the system SHALL provide immediate feedback without requiring the full webview to load, following Pixelary's interaction model
4. IF the post contains a published level THEN the devvit block SHALL display level metadata including title, creator, and difficulty indicators in a card-like layout similar to Pixelary posts
5. WHEN the block is displayed THEN it SHALL use consistent visual styling, typography, and layout patterns that match the Pixelary example implementation

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a Reddit user, I want to perform quick actions directly within the post block, so that I can engage with the content without leaving the Reddit interface.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the devvit block is displayed THEN it SHALL include action buttons for common operations like "Play Now", "View Details", or "Share"
2. WHEN a user clicks "Play Now" THEN the system SHALL launch the full webview experience with the appropriate game mode
3. WHEN a user clicks "View Details" THEN the system SHALL display additional information about the level or challenge within the block
4. WHEN a user performs an action THEN the system SHALL update the block content to reflect the new state
5. IF the user is not authenticated THEN the system SHALL prompt for authentication before allowing certain actions

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a content creator, I want my published levels to have attractive preview blocks, so that other users are more likely to discover and play my content.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a level is published THEN the system SHALL automatically generate a devvit block with level preview information using Pixelary-style card layouts
2. WHEN the block is generated THEN it SHALL include the level title, creator name, difficulty rating, and play count in a visually consistent format matching Pixelary's information hierarchy
3. WHEN other users view the block THEN they SHALL see an engaging visual representation of the level content with thumbnail previews similar to Pixelary's image-based previews
4. IF the level has a custom thumbnail or preview THEN the block SHALL display this visual content prominently in the card header area like Pixelary posts
5. WHEN the creator updates level metadata THEN the block SHALL reflect these changes automatically while maintaining the established visual design patterns

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a moderator, I want to create different types of post blocks for various content types, so that I can organize community content effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating a new post THEN the system SHALL support different block types including "level-card", "weekly-challenge", "landing", and "community-showcase"
2. WHEN a weekly challenge is created THEN the block SHALL display the challenge week, seed information, and current leaderboard preview
3. WHEN a landing post is created THEN the block SHALL show app features, recent community highlights, and getting started actions
4. WHEN a community showcase is created THEN the block SHALL display featured levels, top creators, and community statistics
5. IF the post type is not recognized THEN the system SHALL default to a generic game preview block

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the block system to integrate seamlessly with the existing webview architecture, so that users have a consistent experience when transitioning between the block and full app.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user transitions from block to webview THEN the system SHALL preserve context such as selected level, user preferences, and current state
2. WHEN the webview loads THEN it SHALL receive initialization data from the block interaction
3. WHEN a user returns to Reddit THEN the block SHALL reflect any changes made in the webview session
4. IF the webview fails to load THEN the block SHALL provide fallback options for basic functionality
5. WHEN block actions are performed THEN they SHALL use the same API endpoints as the webview for consistency

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a Reddit user, I want the block content to load quickly and be responsive, so that I can interact with posts without delays.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a post with a devvit block loads THEN the block content SHALL render within 2 seconds
2. WHEN the user interacts with block elements THEN the response SHALL be immediate with appropriate loading states
3. WHEN block data is fetched THEN the system SHALL implement caching to improve subsequent load times
4. IF network connectivity is poor THEN the block SHALL display cached content with appropriate indicators
5. WHEN multiple blocks are visible THEN they SHALL load efficiently without impacting page performance
