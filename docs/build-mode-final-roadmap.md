Total estimated timeline: 10-15 weeks

## Feature Flag Implementation

All Build Mode functionality will be behind feature flags to allow for controlled rollout:

```typescript
// In src/shared/config.ts
export const FeatureFlags = {
  ENABLE_BUILD_MODE: true,
  ENABLE_BUILD_MODE_SHARING: false,
  ENABLE_BUILD_MODE_COMMUNITY: false,
};
```

## Conclusion

This roadmap provides a comprehensive plan for implementing the Build Mode feature in Galaxy Explorer. By following a structured, phase-based approach and incorporating insights from Pixelary, we can create a powerful yet user-friendly level editor that enhances the game experience and fosters community engagement.
