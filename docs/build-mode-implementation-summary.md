# Galaxy Explorer: Build Mode Implementation Plan

## Overview

Based on our analysis of the Galaxy Explorer codebase and the Pixelary example application, we've created a comprehensive implementation plan for the Build Mode feature. This document summarizes our approach and provides links to the detailed planning documents and sample implementation files.

## Key Insights from Pixelary

1. **Step-Based Workflow**: Pixelary uses a clear step-by-step approach for content creation (word selection → drawing → review), which improves user experience.

2. **Service Layer Pattern**: Pixelary implements a centralized service class that handles all data operations and state management.

3. **Clean Separation of Concerns**: The code maintains clear separation between UI, data management, and game logic.

4. **Structured Data Storage**: Redis is used for server-side storage with well-organized key structures.

5. **Progressive Disclosure**: The UI guides the user through the creation process in logical steps.

## Implementation Approach

Our Build Mode feature will follow a similar step-based approach:

1. **Setup Step**: Configure basic level properties and select templates
2. **Design Step**: Place and configure entities in the level
3. **Test Step**: Play and test the level in real-time
4. **Publish Step**: Review and publish the level

We'll implement a service layer pattern for data management, with local storage for initial phases and optional server integration in later phases.

## Key Components

1. **BuildModeScene**: Main container scene that manages the workflow
2. **BuildModeService**: Centralized service for data operations and state management
3. **Step Components**: Individual components for each step in the workflow
4. **Entity Factory**: Creates and configures game entities
5. **UI Components**: Reusable UI elements for the editor

## File Structure

      buildMode.ts                       # Type definitions and schemas
```

## Implementation Phases

Our final roadmap includes five phases with bite-sized steps:

1. **Core Framework & Workflow Structure** (2-3 weeks)
2. **Entity Placement & Properties** (2-3 weeks)
3. **Level Management & Testing** (2-3 weeks)
4. **Advanced Features & Polish** (2-3 weeks)
5. **Integration & Community Features** (2-3 weeks)

For detailed steps in each phase, refer to [build-mode-final-roadmap.md](../docs/build-mode-final-roadmap.md).

## Sample Implementation Files

We've created several sample implementation files to demonstrate our approach:

1. **[BuildModeService.ts](../src/client/game/services/BuildModeService.ts)**: Service layer for data management and state
2. **[BuildModeScene.ts](../src/client/game/scenes/BuildModeScene.ts)**: Main scene for the Build Mode feature
3. **[SetupStep.ts](../src/client/game/scenes/buildMode/SetupStep.ts)**: Implementation of the first step in the workflow

## Development Workflow

For each component or feature:

1. **Implement Foundation**: Create basic structure and integrate with existing system
2. **Add Functionality**: Implement specific features and behaviors
3. **Polish UI**: Enhance the user interface and experience
4. **Test & Refine**: Ensure the feature works as expected

## Next Steps

1. Create the remaining missing files in the structure
2. Implement the BuildModeManager class
3. Complete the step components for the workflow
4. Create the entity factory and UI components
5. Test the basic workflow end-to-end

## Conclusion

This implementation plan provides a structured approach to adding the Build Mode feature to Galaxy Explorer. By adopting a step-based workflow and service layer pattern inspired by Pixelary, we can create a user-friendly experience that encourages creativity and community engagement.
