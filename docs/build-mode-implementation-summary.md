# Galaxy Explorer: Build Mode Implementation Summary

## Overview

Based on our analysis of the Galaxy Explorer codebase and the Pixelary example application, we've created a comprehensive implementation plan for the Build Mode feature. This document summarizes our approach and provides links to the detailed planning documents and sample implementation files.

## Key Insights from Pixelary

1. **Step-Based Workflow**: Pixelary uses a clear step-by-step approach for content creation (word selection → drawing → review), which improves user experience.

2. **Service Layer Pattern**: Pixelary implements a centralized service class that handles all data operations and state management.

3. **Clean Separation of Concerns**: The code maintains clear separation between UI, data management, and game logic.

4. **Structured Data Storage**: Redis is used for server-side storage with well-organized key structures.

5. **Progressive Disclosure**: The UI guides the user through the creation process in logical steps.

## Implementation Approach

Our Build Mode feature follows a step-based approach. Currently implemented steps are Design and Publish, with verification integrated into Publish. Future iterations may add a dedicated Setup/Test UX.

We use a service layer (`BuildModeService`) for data management with LocalStorage, with optional server integration planned via Devvit-backed endpoints.

## Key Components

1. **BuildModeScene**: Main container scene that manages the workflow and common UI
2. **BuildModeService**: Centralized service for data operations (save/load, autosave, import/export, validation)
3. **DesignStep**: Entity placement, palette, grid, selection, and status bar
4. **PublishStep**: Verification run (launch gameplay, capture results) and publish to Reddit post
5. **LevelBrowser**: Local level list UI; browse, select, and manage saved levels
6. **BuildModeManager**: Editor state (selection, tools, grid)
7. **UiKit**: Reusable UI primitives (pill buttons, panels, overlays, toasts)

        buildMode/                       # Step-based components

```

## Implementation Phases

Our final roadmap includes five phases with bite-sized steps:

1. **Core Framework & Workflow Structure** (2-3 weeks)
2. **Entity Placement & Properties** (2-3 weeks)
3. **Level Management & Testing** (2-3 weeks)
4. **Advanced Features & Polish** (2-3 weeks)
5. **Integration & Community Features** (2-3 weeks)

For detailed steps in each phase, refer to [build-mode-final-roadmap.md](./build-mode-final-roadmap.md) and [build-mode-roadmap.md](./build-mode-roadmap.md).

## Sample Implementation Files

Selected implementation entry points:

1. **[BuildModeService.ts](../src/client/game/services/BuildModeService.ts)**: Persistence, autosave, import/export, validation
2. **[BuildModeScene.ts](../src/client/game/scenes/BuildModeScene.ts)**: Step orchestration and common UI header
3. **[DesignStep.ts](../src/client/game/scenes/buildMode/DesignStep.ts)**: Grid, palette, placement, selection, status bar
4. **[PublishStep.ts](../src/client/game/scenes/buildMode/PublishStep.ts)**: Verification flow and publish-to-Reddit
5. **[LevelBrowser.ts](../src/client/game/ui/LevelBrowser.ts)**: Local level browsing and actions

## Development Workflow

For each component or feature:

1. **Implement Foundation**: Create basic structure and integrate with existing system
2. **Add Functionality**: Implement specific features and behaviors
3. **Polish UI**: Enhance the user interface and experience
4. **Test & Refine**: Ensure the feature works as expected

## Current Gaps / Next Steps

1. Property editing UI for entities (lightweight panel or inline controls)
2. Optional dedicated Setup/Test UX (Design embeds many flows today; Publish handles verification)
3. Community features behind flags (sharing browser, ratings, leaderboards) once backend is ready
4. Additional templates and validation rules
5. Polishing tutorials and help overlays

## Conclusion

This implementation plan provides a structured approach to adding the Build Mode feature to Galaxy Explorer. By adopting a step-based workflow and service layer pattern inspired by Pixelary, we can create a user-friendly experience that encourages creativity and community engagement.
