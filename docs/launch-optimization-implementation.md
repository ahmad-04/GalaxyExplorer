# Launch Optimization Implementation Summary

**Date:** October 20, 2025  
**Status:** âœ… Implemented  
**Goal:** Reduce game launch times by 50-70%

## Changes Implemented

### 1. âœ… Reduced Timeouts & Artificial Delays

#### Splash Screen Timeout

- **Before:** 2-7 seconds depending on launch source
- **After:**
  - Block launches: 500ms (75% faster)
  - Direct access: 1.5s (78% faster)
- **File:** `src/client/main.ts`

#### LoadingScene Minimum Time

- **Before:** 1.2 second artificial minimum delay
- **After:** No artificial delay - loads as fast as assets allow
- **File:** `src/client/game/scenes/LoadingScene.ts`

#### MainMenu Auto-Start Delay

- **Before:** 500ms delay before handling auto-start
- **After:** No delay - handled instantly or skipped entirely
- **File:** `src/client/game/scenes/MainMenu.ts`

---

### 2. âœ… Direct Launch Path (Skip MainMenu)

#### Smart Scene Routing

When launched from blocks with auto-start flags, the game now:

1. Loads assets in `LoadingScene`
2. **Skips `MainMenu` entirely**
3. Routes directly to game scene

#### Implementation Details

- **New Method:** `LoadingScene.startDirectLaunch()`
- Detects `autoStartGame` or `autoStartBuild` flags
- Routes to appropriate scene:
  - `autoStartGame` â†’ `StarshipScene` (custom level) or `EndlessScene`
  - `autoStartBuild` â†’ `BuildModeScene` with action parameter

#### Transition Speed

- **Before:** LoadingScene (500ms fade) â†’ MainMenu (500ms delay) â†’ Game
- **After:** LoadingScene (200ms fade) â†’ **Game**
- **Savings:** ~800ms per launch

### 3. âœ… Better Progress Feedback

#### Enhanced Splash Screen

- **Added:** Dynamic hint text (3rd line)
- **Added:** Smooth progress bar transitions
- **Added:** Contextual messages based on what's loading

#### Progress Steps with Context

| Progress | Status                  | Hint Message                                           |
| -------- | ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| 0%       | Initializing            | "Preparing your adventure..."                          |
| 10%      | Starting                | "Initializing game engine"                             |
| 20%      | Loading core assets     | "Ship, weapons, and enemies"                           |
| 40%      | Core assets loaded      | "âœ“ Ready to fly!"                                      |
| 45%      | Checking custom level   | "Looking for community content"                        |
| 50%      | Loading community level | Level title or "Fetching level data"                   |
| 75%      | Custom level ready      | "âœ“ Community creation loaded"                          |
| 60%      | Default campaign        | "Standard missions loaded"                             |
| 80%      | Preparing menu/game     | "Building user interface" or "Almost ready to launch!" |
| 90%      | Finalizing              | "Final preparations"                                   |
| 100%     | Ready                   | "ðŸš€ Launching game!" or "âœ“ All systems go!"            |

#### Visual Improvements

- Smooth CSS transitions on progress bar
- Percentage-based ARIA labels for accessibility
- Contextual emojis for visual feedback

## Performance Impact

### Expected Improvements

| Launch Type               | Before | After    | Improvement       |
| ------------------------- | ------ | -------- | ----------------- |
| **Block â†’ Game (direct)** | 4-9s   | 1.5-2.5s | **60-70% faster** |
| **Block â†’ Build Mode**    | 4-9s   | 1.5-2.5s | **60-70% faster** |
| **Menu â†’ Game**           | 2-4s   | 0.8-1.5s | **50-60% faster** |
| **Initial Load**          | 7-12s  | 3-5s     | **50-60% faster** |

### Breakdown by Optimization

| Optimization                 | Time Saved   |
| ---------------------------- | ------------ |
| Reduced splash timeout       | 1.5-5.5s     |
| Removed LoadingScene delay   | 0.3-1.2s     |
| Skip MainMenu for auto-start | 0.5-1.0s     |
| Faster scene transitions     | 0.3-0.5s     |
| **Total Potential Savings**  | **2.6-8.2s** |

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Test block launch to game (campaign mode)
- [ ] Test block launch to game (community levels)
- [ ] Test block launch to build mode
- [ ] Test direct access from main menu
- [ ] Test with custom level loaded
- [ ] Test with no custom level
- [ ] Verify progress messages display correctly
- [ ] Verify smooth transitions
- [ ] Test on slow connection
- [ ] Test fallback to MainMenu on error

## Future Optimizations (Not Yet Implemented)

### High Impact

- [ ] Parallel asset loading
- [ ] Lazy load Kla'ed enemy variants
- [ ] Asset preloading in HTML

### Medium Impact

- [ ] Consolidate config loading
- [ ] Prevent duplicate published level fetching
- [ ] Progressive asset loading

### Low Impact

- [ ] Asset compression review
- [ ] Sprite atlas implementation
- [ ] WebP/MP3 format conversion

---

## Rollback Plan

If issues arise, revert these commits:

1. Restore splash timeout to 2-7s in `main.ts`
2. Restore 1.2s minimum in `LoadingScene.ts`
3. Restore MainMenu routing in `LoadingScene.ts`
4. Restore 500ms delay in `MainMenu.ts`

---

## Notes

- Empty catch blocks in LoadingScene are intentional (non-critical fallbacks)
- Auto-start flags are cleared after use to prevent repeated execution
- MainMenu still has fallback auto-start logic in case LoadingScene routing fails
- All changes are backwards compatible with existing save data
- No breaking changes to API or data structures
