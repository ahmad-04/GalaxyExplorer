# Debug Mode Setup Complete ‚úÖ

## Implementation Summary

Successfully implemented Scout-only debug mode with visual hitbox debugging for enemy development.

## What Was Done

### 1. **Scout-Only Spawning**

- Modified `EnemyManager.ts` to force Scout enemy spawns only
- Added `DEBUG_SCOUT_ONLY` flag (currently set to `true`)
- Console logging: `üõ∏ [DEBUG] Spawning Scout (debug mode active)`

### 2. **Physics Debug Hitboxes**

- Enabled Phaser's built-in physics debug rendering in `StarshipScene.ts`
- Added `DEBUG_MODE` flag (currently set to `true`)
- Shows collision boundaries as colored outlines

### 3. **Color-Coded Hitboxes**

- **Player Ship:** Cyan (0x00ffff) - Easy to identify
- **Scout Enemies:** Green (0x00ff00) - Clear distinction
- Set via `body.debugBodyColor` property

### 4. **Enhanced Console Logging**

- Scout spawn details logged automatically
- Includes: position, hitbox radius, speed, HP, movement type
- Example output:
  ```
  üõ∏ Scout spawned: {
    position: { x: 234, y: -60 },
    bodyRadius: 16,
    speed: 120,
    hp: 1,
    movement: 'sine'
  }
  ```

### 5. **Documentation**

- Created `docs/scout-debug-mode.md` with complete instructions
- Includes how to enable/disable, visual indicators, and next steps

## Files Modified

```
‚úÖ src/client/game/entities/EnemyManager.ts
   - Added DEBUG_SCOUT_ONLY toggle
   - Added debug comment block

‚úÖ src/client/game/scenes/StarshipScene.ts
   - Added DEBUG_MODE toggle
   - Enabled physics debug rendering
   - Set player hitbox color (cyan)

‚úÖ src/client/game/entities/enemies/EnemyBase.ts
   - Set enemy hitbox color (green)
   - Added Scout spawn logging

‚úÖ docs/scout-debug-mode.md
   - Complete documentation
```

## How to Test

1. **Run the game** (npm run dev or your preferred method)
2. **Watch the console** for Scout spawn logs
3. **Observe the hitboxes:**
   - Cyan circle around your ship (player)
   - Green circles around Scout enemies
4. **Test Scout behavior:**
   - Movement patterns (sine wave)
   - Speed (120 base)
   - Collision detection accuracy
   - HP (1 hit kill)

## Next Steps - Scout Development

Now you can work on Scout characteristics:

### Immediate Tasks

- [ ] Test current Scout movement pattern
- [ ] Verify hitbox feels accurate for gameplay
- [ ] Adjust Scout speed if needed
- [ ] Test evasion behavior (if implemented)

### Enhancement Ideas

- [ ] Add dodge mechanics when player fires
- [ ] Implement speed burst ability
- [ ] Create more erratic zigzag patterns
- [ ] Add cyan particle trail effect
- [ ] Implement flee behavior at low HP
- [ ] Add circling/diving attack patterns
- [ ] Fine-tune score value (high risk/reward)

### Visual Enhancements

- [ ] Speed lines when boosting
- [ ] Engine glow intensity variation
- [ ] Trail particle effects
- [ ] Hit animation tweaks

## Toggle Debug Mode

### To Disable Debug Mode:

```typescript
// In EnemyManager.ts (line ~162)
const DEBUG_SCOUT_ONLY = false; // All enemies spawn

// In StarshipScene.ts (line ~259)
const DEBUG_MODE = false; // Hide hitboxes
```

### To Re-Enable:

```typescript
const DEBUG_SCOUT_ONLY = true; // Scout only
const DEBUG_MODE = true; // Show hitboxes
```

## Console Indicators

When debug mode is active, look for:

```
üîç DEBUG MODE: Physics debug hitboxes ENABLED
üõ∏ DEBUG MODE: Scout-only spawning active
üõ∏ [DEBUG] Spawning Scout (debug mode active)
üõ∏ Scout spawned: { ... detailed stats ... }
```

## Success Criteria ‚úÖ

- [x] Only Scouts spawn in game
- [x] Hitboxes visible (cyan player, green enemies)
- [x] Console logs Scout spawn details
- [x] Easy to toggle on/off
- [x] Documentation complete
- [x] Ready for Scout behavior development

## Notes

- Pre-existing lint warnings (from `as any` casts) are unrelated to our changes
- Debug mode is ENABLED by default for immediate Scout testing
- Hitbox colors chosen for maximum contrast and clarity
- All changes are isolated and easy to toggle/remove

**Status:** ‚úÖ Ready for Scout Development
**Next:** Work on Scout-specific characteristics and behaviors
