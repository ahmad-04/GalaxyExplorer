## Tasks
- [ ] Update main menu to include Build Mode option
- [ ] Implement level sharing (if backend supports it)
- [ ] Add rating/favoriting system for levels
- [ ] Add level challenges/achievements

## Technical Details

- [ ] Levels can be shared with other players (if backend supports)
- [ ] Players can rate and favorite levels
- [ ] Level challenges track completion and progress
- [ ] Leaderboards show scores for custom levels

## Files to Modify
